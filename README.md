![alt text](image.png)

**Live Demo:** https://a2rp.github.io/todo-list-crud/

A small, production-friendly To-Do app built with **React + styled-components** (frontend only). Supports CRUD, categories, due dates, search, sort, LocalStorage, and a custom confirm modal—kept transparent to blend with a black-themed website.

## Features

-   Add, edit, delete tasks (CRUD)
-   Categories with filter
-   Due dates with “days left / overdue”
-   Search (title/category)
-   Sort: newest, due ↑, due ↓
-   LocalStorage persistence
-   Custom confirm modal (delete & bulk actions)
-   Black-theme friendly (no background overrides)

## Local Install

```bash
